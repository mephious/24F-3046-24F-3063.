🏰 Stronghold: Medieval Kingdom Management Game
A console-based multiplayer strategy simulation game that challenges players to manage a medieval kingdom using advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++. The game features both internal kingdom management and external diplomacy, trade, and warfare with other kingdoms.

📖 Project Overview
Stronghold is a two-module system that simulates the complex dynamics of ruling a medieval kingdom. It's designed as part of an OOP lab project at National University of Computer & Emerging Sciences, Faisalabad-Chiniot Campus.

Module 1: Core Kingdom Engine
This module focuses on internal kingdom mechanics such as population, economy, military, politics, and resource systems. Players must balance these systems to keep their kingdom from collapsing.

Module 2: Multiplayer & Diplomacy Engine
The second module extends the kingdom's logic to interact with other kingdoms in a multiplayer setting. This includes communication, alliances, trade, conflict resolution, and territorial management.
